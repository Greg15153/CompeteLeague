										Compte League was created in the summer of 2013 by the owner Noble “CL Lolshock” Burrow. It started out as an opportunity for less skilled players of bronze/silver to live the life of LCS like pro gamers. Season 1 split was a great success and brought many motivated players back. Players loved to experience the dedication and teamwork of being with a team. They awed at themselves on twitch as they made big plays with the enthusiastic staff of casters behind them.  
This year our goals and ambitions are greater than ever. We plan to have leagues from all skill levels from Bronze to Challenger all streamed. We have grown our staff from just a few to over 20 including casters, writers, video editors, and more!
