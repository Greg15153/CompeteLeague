										<!-- Content --><p>Compete League has had two sucessful splits and is ready for a new season. Over the break we have been working hard on launching a new and improved website that will make it easier for everyone. We have gone through staff applications to fill caster positions, staticians, organizers, and more. Bringing in new staff will ensure we run smoothly and better than ever. Specifically we have asked for video editors and writers to join us so expect alot of new and exciting content. Along new staff and a new website we are proud to announce our league expansion to include silver, platinum, and diamond so everyone can have a chance to play and compete.</p>
